## MSc Forest and Nature Conservation student, also interested in data science and the intersection of the two.

Currently working on my thesis, using occupancy modelling to understand the colonisation dynamics of *Halictus quadricinctus* in south Limburg. 
Also taking the OSSU data science course to build up my data science foundations and learn more coding languages!
